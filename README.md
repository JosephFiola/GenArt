A git repository of me going through the code examples from Matt Pearson's book entitled generative art.

The code in this git repository is me rewriting code verbatim from the book and also any exploratory derivatives I may come up with in the learning process. I will not be retranscribbing every single example from the book but only the ones I feel I need to try.

I find the listing identification in the official download code doesn't match the listings printed in the book.
My code is identified by the listing from the book therefore will not be named in sync with the official code download.
